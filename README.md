# multitracer_densitysplit
Contains codes and relevant work for the Phys 437A research project in Fall 2022 at UWaterloo, under supervision of Professor Will Percival and Postdoc Enrique Paillas, from the Large-Scale Structure Group. Work focuses on using AbacusSummit simulations to test the improvement on cosmological constraints provided by the Multi-Tracer method, when using halo catalogues to generate density environments (quantiles) and using these as biased tracers of matter density.
